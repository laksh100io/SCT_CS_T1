# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption in Python

This is a simple Python script that implements the **Caesar Cipher**, one of the most basic and widely known encryption techniques.

## 📌 What is Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. It is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to protect military messages.

### Example

If shift = 2:
- A → C
- B → D
- X → Z
- Y → A
- Z → B

So the word `hello` becomes `jgnnq`.

💻 Features:
- Encrypt any message using a shift value
- Decrypt a Caesar-encrypted message
- Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Leaves spaces and punctuation unchanged

🧑‍💻 How to Use:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher-python.git
    cd caesar-cipher-python
    ```
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python caesar_cipher.py
    ```
3. Follow the prompts:
    - Choose `'e'` to encrypt or `'d'` to decrypt.
    - Enter your message.
    - Enter the shift number.
